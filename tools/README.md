## Debug

### gdb

- swiss army knife
- I don't use major plugins in userland such as `pwndbg`, cuz it is too heavy for kernel.
- for my `.gdbinit`, refer to [dotfiles](https://github.com/smallkirby/dotfiles/blob/master/gdb/.gdbinit).

### QEMU monitor

- TBD

### gdb-pt-dump

- [gdb-pt-dump](https://github.com/martinradev/gdb-pt-dump) by [@martinradev](https://github.com/martinradev).
- useful tool to debug page tables.
